# Our Protocol vs Falcon and Fiat-Shamir

## 1. Unique Features and Optimizations
- **Multi-challenge protocol**: Four distinct challenge types (Fiat-Shamir, horizontal/vertical hyperbola, modified FS)
- **Challenge-specific commitment generation**: Each commitment is only valid for one challenge, ensuring strict soundness
- **Efficient, constant-time polynomial sampling**: Uses numpy for uniform and small-coefficient sampling
- **Highly optimized NTT/INTT**: Vectorized numpy and Numba JIT implementations for fast, constant-time polynomial arithmetic
- **Batch NTT**: Parallel NTT for batch signing/verification
- **In-place, memory-efficient operations**: Minimal temporary arrays, in-place numpy math
- **Automated benchmarking**: Scripted, fair, multi-iteration comparison of keygen, sign, verify, and size

## 2. Security and Correctness Properties
- **Special soundness**: No cross-challenge forgeries possible (empirically tested)
- **Empirical zero-knowledge**: Simulated transcripts indistinguishable from real ones
- **Negative/forgery tests**: Random and near-miss responses always fail verification
- **Replay/fault attack resistance**: Modifying or replaying signatures fails verification
- **Batch/cross-challenge tests**: Batch and cross-challenge verifications are robust

## 3. Performance Benchmarking Methodology
- **Automated script**: `benchmark/benchmark_suite.py` runs 100+ iterations of keygen, sign, verify for all schemes
- **Measures**: Average and best-case times, signature and key sizes
- **Comparison**: Designed to compare your protocol, Falcon (Python), and Fiat-Shamir/Schnorr (if available)
- **Fairness**: All schemes run on the same hardware, with the same message/key sizes
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new schemes or more iterations

## 4. Advanced Features
- **Numba JIT NTT/INTT**: `ntt_numba`, `intt_numba` for high-speed, constant-time transforms
- **Batch NTT**: `batch_ntt_numba` for parallel batch operations
- **Multiprocessing for batch sign/verify**: Example code for parallel signing/verifying
- **Profiling hooks**: Use `cProfile` or `timeit` to find and optimize bottlenecks

## 5. Mathematical Time Complexity Comparison

### Key Operations
- **N**: Degree of the polynomial (e.g., 512, 1024)
- **q**: Modulus (large prime)

| Scheme         | Keygen Complexity         | Sign Complexity           | Verify Complexity         | Dominant Operations                |
|----------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Our Protocol   | O(N log N)               | O(N log N)                | O(N log N)                | NTT, poly mult, hash, sampling      |
| Falcon         | O(N log N)               | O(N log N)                | O(N log N)                | NTT, poly mult, hash, sampling      |
| Fiat-Shamir    | O(N) or O(N log N)*      | O(N) or O(N log N)*       | O(N) or O(N log N)*       | Poly mult, hash, sampling           |

*If implemented with NTT, complexity is O(N log N); otherwise, O(N) for simple group operations (e.g., Schnorr over elliptic curves).

### Explanations
- **NTT (Number Theoretic Transform):** Used for fast polynomial multiplication, dominates time for large N. O(N log N) per transform.
- **Polynomial Multiplication:** O(N log N) with NTT, O(N^2) naively.
- **Hashing and Sampling:** O(N) per operation, but much faster in practice than NTT.
- **Falcon:** Uses NTT for all heavy math, so matches our protocol in asymptotic complexity.
- **Fiat-Shamir/Schnorr:** If implemented over polynomials with NTT, matches O(N log N); if over elliptic curves or integers, typically O(N).

### Practical Note
- In practice, constant factors and implementation details (vectorization, JIT, parallelism) make a big difference. Our protocol leverages Numba JIT and batch parallelism for further speedup.

## 7. How to Run and Interpret
- **Run all tests**: `python test_security_properties.py` for security/correctness
- **Run benchmarks**: `python benchmark/benchmark_suite.py` for performance
- **Interpret results**: Tables and printouts show which protocol is faster, smaller, and more robust
- **Add your own schemes**: Plug in Falcon or Fiat-Shamir Python code for direct comparison
- **Profile**: Use `cProfile` or `timeit` to further optimize
